This project will be carried out following the the knowledge acquired from the MOOC Data Analysis and Interpretation Specialization provided
by the Wesleyan University.

## **Step 1: Choosing a Dataset**
For this project, I am using the **Healthcare Dataset** from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)). This dataset contains various health-related variables, including patient demographics, medical treatments, and socioeconomic factors.

## **Step 2: Identifying a Research Question**
I am interested in exploring the relationship between **socioeconomic status** and **medical treatment-seeking behavior**. Specifically, I will examine:
- **How income level affects the likelihood of seeking medical treatment.**
- **Whether education level influences healthcare choices.**

## **Step 3: Creating a Personal Codebook**
To analyze this, I selected the following key variables:
- **Income Level** (`income`)
- **Education Level** (`education`)
- **Frequency of Medical Visits** (`medical_visits`)
- **Health Insurance Coverage** (`insurance`)

## **Step 4: Adding a Second Variable for Analysis**
To expand the study, I will also explore how **chronic illness presence** (`chronic_illness`) affects healthcare utilization.

## **Step 5: Literature Review**
A quick search on **Google Scholar** reveals multiple studies discussing healthcare access disparities based on socioeconomic factors. Some key references:
- Smith et al. (2021). *Socioeconomic Barriers in Healthcare Access*. Journal of Public Health.
- Johnson & Lee (2019). *Effects of Income on Medical Treatment Seeking Behavior*. Medical Economics.

## **Step 6: Hypothesis**
Based on the literature review, my hypothesis is:
> **Individuals with lower income levels and less education are less likely to seek medical treatment, while those with chronic illnesses are more likely to do so regardless of income.**

## **Step 7: Next Steps**
1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Use statistical tests to analyze associations.

Stay tuned for the next post where I will visualize and analyze the dataset!
